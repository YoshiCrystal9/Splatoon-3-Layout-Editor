# Splatoon 3 Stage Layout Viewer
A Stage Layout viewer for Splatoon 3! (Made using KillzX's Sample-Editor and Sheldon10095's Splatoon 2 Stage Layout Editor)

## Notes
- Models don't load
- They don't have any position in the 3D space

## Libraries

- Map Studio UI : The UI engine used to display this editor running off imgui. 
- Toolbox.Core : A small, portable backend used for file IO to read/write data along with commonly shared things like texture swizzling and decoding.
